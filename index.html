<h1>Important CSS remarks:</h1>

        <p>
            This course is beginning with <strong>HTML5</strong> but I decided that a little CSS is needed from the beginning so I can start practicing. I know that my self-taught CSS is far from being ok, though.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSS3 lessons will come around mid march/22. I say this on February 11, 2022.</p>
    
        <p>There are three ways you can use to implement CSS into your HTML:</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="color: blue; background-color: rgb(231, 229, 229);">"INTERNAL"</span>: When it's added in the "head" section of your document;</li>
                    <li><span style="color: blue; background-color:  rgb(231, 229, 229);">"INLINE"</span>: Applyed to a specific HTLM element in a line or paragraph; </li>
                    <li><span style="color: blue; background-color:  rgb(231, 229, 229);">"EXTERNAL"</span>: All the CSS lies on a separate document in your project, properly linked to the HTML document. That's the most used way.</li>
                </ol>
    
        <p>This purple box here (and its drop-shadow) was implemented by the <span style="color: blue; background-color:  rgb(231, 229, 229);">"EXTERNAL"</span> way. But the blue and white effect in these words here were done <span style="color: blue; background-color:  rgb(231, 229, 229);">"INLINE"</span>, with the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag.</p>

        <p id="para1">Among the simplest CSS features, I'll be using the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>  tag to make bold text and the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>  tag to make italic before the first lessons mention them. The same goes to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>  tag to make links.</p>

        <p id="para1">This orange color is made by the <code>id</code> global attribute just for testing the CSS <code>#id</code> Selector. It styles the element (in this case, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>  paragraph) with the specified id.</p>
            
        <p id="para1">The HTML5 tag: <code>&lt;p id="para1"&gt;</code></p>

        <p id="para1">The CSS3 selector (must be in the "internal" or "external" areas (see above) not "inline"):</p>


<pre style="margin-left: 50px;">
                
<code>#para1 { 
    color:rgb(224, 54, 2); 
        } </code>
                
</pre>

   
        <p>For CSS selector reference check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">w3schools.</a></p>

        <p>By the way, I check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >w3schools</a> after almost ever lesson I watch. Its lightweight, clean, precise and it has a very objective "try yourself" button for every subject of each technology.</p>
        
        
        <div class="obs">
            <p>
                Maybe I'm overusing CSS. Sorry. I have to <em>overpractice</em> while I can.
            </p>

            <p>
                I realize that my CSS is imperfect. For instance, image boxes are losing alignment when the screen zoom changes to more than 100%. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And this is only one of the mistakes. Again, I'm aware of them and will learn the right way when the lessons get to that point.

<h1>THE COURSE STARTS HERE</h1>

</div>

<hr>


<h1>HTML <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> Declaration</h1>

            <p>All HTML5 documents <mark>must</mark> start with a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration.</p>
            <p>The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.</p>
            <p>In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:</p>
            <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></p>

            <p>The 3 paragraphs above were taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3schools.</a> It's worth a visit.</p>

            <p>That's how an HTML5 document is born. Of course you have to save the document as <em>"some_name".html</em>. For instance, <em>index.html</em>.</p>

            <p>Any other thing typed after <code>!DOCTYPE</code> than only <code>html</code> will not make an HTML5 document. It could build a previous and outdated html document (like html4) or nothing at all if it's an invalid code.</p>

            <p>But you don't have to type it all. Not in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor.</p>

            <p><mark>VS Code has a typing assistant called Emmet</mark> that sort of guesses what you are about to type and gives you hints to choose.</p>

            <P>Thus, <mark>just type <code>!</code> in a blank HTML document</mark>. The figure of a tool followed by any options of <code>!</code> Emmet may have wil instantly appear in a blue background near to your cursor, like that:</P>

            
    <figure>
            <img src="images/emmet.jpg" width="1000px" alt="Visual Studio Code screen with Emmet in action.">

    </figure>       
                
                
                
            <p>Then, press <code>Enter</code> and it's done.</p>

            <p>Learn more about Emmet in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code website.</a></p>

            <p>What will appear as a result of that is the folowing:</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/html-skeleton-from-codegrepper-dot-com.png" alt="html skeleton.">
                <figcaption><em>Credit:Image from codegrepper.com</em></figcaption>
            </figure>

        <p><mark>AND LATER, WHEN YOU PROGRESS IN FRONT-END:</mark></p>
        <p>You will implement some mandatory things to that basic srtucture, like the:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Link to <em>external</em>* CSS <mark>stylesheet</mark> (in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area) 
        </li>
        <li>
            The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> link (in the end of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> area) to an <em>external</em>* JavaScript document.
        </li>
    </ol>        
        <p>* <em>External to the html document but still being part of your project.</em></p>
        <p>See how the few extra implements will look like:</p>

            <img src="images/html-incremented-skeleton-css-js-from-cloudinary-dot-com.jpg" alt="html skeleton." width="600px">
            <figcaption><em>Credit:Image from cloudinary.com</em></figcaption>
            
            </figure>

<h1>Title</h1>
        
        <p>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area is the name your page or website will display in the TAB top.</p>
        <p>An example from seo-gold.com:</p>

            <figure>
            <img src="images/title-tag-html-seo-gold-dot-com.jpg" width="600px">
            <figcaption><em>Credit:Image from seo-gold.com</em></figcaption>
            </figure>

<h1>HTML Semantic Elements</h1>

        <p>Semantic elements = elements with a meaning. <mark>HTML5 was built to be semantic, to attribute meaning to its content</mark>.</p>

        <p>What are Semantic Elements?</p>
        <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</p>

        <p style="color: blueviolet; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">The opposite of that are the CSS styles, which give a <em>form</em>, a <em>look</em> to the content, like now.</p>

        <p>Examples of non-semantic elements: <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> - Tells nothing about its content, they just select an area (to be worked by CSS or JS).</p>

        <p>Examples of semantic elements: <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and many others. They clearly define their content.</p>
        <p>Learn more at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">w3schools</a>.</p>

<h1><em>hr</em> tag</h1>

        <p>The <code> &lt;hr&gt;</code>* tag (hr stands for "horizontal rule". It makes an HORIZONTAL LINE). The the <span style="color: red;">red line</span> above here. It's originally black but I applied some <span style="color: blue;">style (=CSS)</span>  to it in the <span style="color: blue;">head</span> area of the HTML basic structure (but here, in this paragraph, the colors/style were modified in the middle of the paragraph (the so called "<span style="color: blue;">inline CSS</span>" explained above.), using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> 3 times).</p>




<h1><em>br</em>  tag</h1>
        <p> The br tag breaks a line like now <br> (for whatever reason you may have), without being a paragraph. (after the word "now" there is a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag)</p>

<h1><em>del</em> tag</h1>

        <p>The <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> tag <del>marks a text as non-valid</del> or deleted.</p>

<h1><em>ins</em> tag</h1>
        <p>The <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> tag underlines the text to give the kind of enphasis s if he text has been <ins>filled in the blank space, or inserted</ins>.</p>
        <p><mark>Don't confuse this tag with the "u" one</mark>. "U" is not semantic. It just <u>underlines</u> and that's it, no meanings whatsoever.</p>

<h1><em>small</em> tag</h1>
        <p>This tag can be used in those small <small>contract/agreement/purchase order/invoice</small> letters.</p>
        <p>The <big>"big"</big> tag is not used any longer. It works, thou. This task (enlarging) now is CSS business.</p>
<h1><em>sup</em> tag</h1>
        <p>The superscript tag is good to format things like 18<sup>25</sup>+3, for instance.</p>

<h1><em>sub</em> tag</h1>
        <p>The subscript tag doesn't make it rain but can make the H<sub>2</sub>O formula.</p>

<h1><a id="above">Entities</a></h1>  
    <h3>Entities are used to return / display special symbols.</h3>
            
        <p>"An HTML <strong>entity</strong>  is used to display <strong>invisible characters</strong>   and <strong>reserved characters</strong>  that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code.</p>
        
        <p> <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">An HTML entity is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).</span></p>

        <p>For instance, HTML will interpret the less-than sign ( &lt; ) as a tag opening if you don't write it as an entity.</p>

    <h2>The <code>&amp;lt;</code> entity makes <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span></h2>
        <p>
            When I type the 3 characters above together (without scaping through an entity) they make this symbol: &lt;</p>
        <p>
            But if I want to show you the code that makes &lt; I have to replace the & (ampersand) for its respactive entity, which is "&amp;amp".
        </p>
        <p><strong>lt</strong> (LT in lowercase) means <q>LESS THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

    <h2>The <code>&amp;gt;</code> entity makes <span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span> </h2>
        <p>The same as above applies here, with "gt" instead of that.</p>
        
        <!-- Comentário é assim, lembra? Abre tag, exclamação, dois traços. -->

        <p><strong>gt</strong>  means <q>GREATER THAN.</q></p>

        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end, as well.</P>


    <h3>Here we have some symbols written this way:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>&reg;</li>
        <li>&copy;</li>
        <li>&trade;</li>

<h1>Emojis:</h1>
        <p>Emojis codes are a little more complicated to insert.</p>
        <p>First go to a website like the one linked below and:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose the emoji;</li>
            <li>Scroll down until you find the word "Codepoints".</li>
            <li>Copy that code and paste it in your editor.</li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT COMPLICATION: Remove the u+ and replace it with &#x then add a ; (semicolon) at the end.</li>
            <li>Could be easier. Should be easier. Must be easier!!!</li>
            <li>Of course when you get to the site linked below you may just copy and paste the emoji itself (just like that: 😊), but it won't work in some browsers, as teacher Guanabara said.</li>
        </ol>


        <p><a href="https://emojipedia.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Through this link you to to a COMPLETE LIST of emojis and their codes.</a></p>

        <p>And here we have some emojis coded the complicated (and only) way to code emojis:</p>

<h1>Images</h1>


        <p>Always be sure that you are not violating copyrights when pasting images made by someone else into your website.</p>
        <p>There are royalty free images around the web, like:</p>
        <p><a href="https://pixnio.com/pt/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixnio</a></p>
        <p>Or</p>
        <p><a href="https://pxhere.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pxhere</a></p>
        <p>Or many others.</p>
        <p>This image is from Pixnio. Very easy. You don't even have to register in their website. And you have size options. You can even chose a personalized one with the width or height of your preference.</p>

        <div class="canyon">

        </div>


    <h2>How to add images to your page</h2>

    <h3>1) From a folder of yours:</h3>

        <p>First, download the image to your "images" folder within your HTML project.</p>
        <p>(If you're a beginner like me, going through Visual Studio Code tutorials is not a bad idea)</p>
        <p>Then, in the VSCode editor: just type <code>img</code> and Emmet, the automatic assistant, will write the rest for you. After it's done, place the cursor in between the first pair of quotation marks (src="") of the "img" tag, press ctrl+spacebar and chose your image from your folder on the dialogue box.</p>
        <p>The second pair of quotation marks (alt="") of the "img" tag are for you to write a quick description of the picture. It serves to appear in the screen in case the image doesn't load for any reason AND to be read out loud for those who wish the browser to do that.</p>
        

    <h3>2) Straight from another website:</h3>

        <p>Copying an image <strong>address</strong>   from another website is an alternative way of adding an image to your page.</p>
        <p>The disadvantage is that the image in your page will always depend on the existence of the original one and more: it must be exactly where it was when you copied the eddress. If their website crashes, your linked image crashes. If they change anything in the addres, the link is gone and so does the image.</p>
        <p>Just right click any image of any website and choose "copy image address" (or whatever is closer to that). Then, paste it between the first pair of quotation marks (src="") of the "img" tag.</p>
        <p>Again: The second pair of quotation marks (alt="") of the "img" tag are for you to write a quick description of the picture. It serves to appear in the screen in case the image doesn't load for any reason AND to be read out loud for those who wish the browser to do that.</p>
        <p>This is an example (linked from G1.com):</p>
        <img src="https://s2.glbimg.com/DHCxxKd2oxxJwWNSGcbtwhTDapA=/0x0:1200x5562/640x0/smart/filters:strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_59edd422c0c84a879bd37670ae4f538a/internal_photos/bs/2022/8/c/wBz1OySaygj4v3cLRJTw/0102-cadeira-escritorio-ergonomia.jpg" alt="Imagem do G1" width="300">

    <h2>Types of images</h2>

        <p>In a few words:</p>

        <hr>

        <p>JPG (or JPEG) Is better if you want a big image with less weight, like this one:</p>


        <div class="pic">
        <img src="images/landscape.jpg" alt="swimming pool near the ocean landdscape" width="1200px">
        </div>
    <hr>

    <div class="blue">

        <p style="font-size:x-large; text-align: justify;">PNG images are better if you want the picture itself to have a transparent background (and no picture frame), like these ones:</p>

        
            <div class="balls-hand">
                <img src="images/baloon.png" alt="baloons" width="400px">
            </div>

            <div class="balls-hand">
                <img src="images/hand.png" alt="hand" width="300px" >
            </div>

            <div class="balls-hand">           
                <img src="images/spiderman.png" alt="baloons" width="200px">

        <p style="text-align: justify;">I've implemented a blue background (in a "div" "class" called "balls-hand" inside another div class called "blue" in the head sector of this HTML document) to make it easier to check the image's transparency and to align them. <br>Images from <a href="https://www.pngwing.com/en/search?q=free+download" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pngwing.com</a> .</p>

<h1>Favicon</h1>

        <p>"A favicon is a small icon or collection of icons associated with a website, web page, or web application. It's displayed within the browser tabs and bookmarks bar".  <a href="https://favicon.io/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Favicon.io</a></p>

        <p>"A favicon is used to help users visually identify websites, web pages, and web applications within browser tabs, bookmarks, shortcuts, and address bars more easily. It's important to have a favicon for your website for brand recognition so that your users can easily identify your site in their browser tabs and bookmarks". <a href="https://favicon.io/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Favicon.io</a></p>

        <p>Examples of favicon:</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/example01-favicon.jpg" alt="Example of favicon-01" width="25%">
        <hr>
        <img src="images/example02-favicon.jpg" alt="Example of favicon-02" width="25%">
        <hr>


        

    <h2>What are common favicon file formats?</h2>
    <h3>ICO - favicon.ico</h3>
        <p>"The most common favicon formats are ICO, PNG, and SVG, but there are additional formats for specific browsers or devices. The ICO file format was developed by Microsoft and is the original file format for the favicon. The format is unique because it allows for multiple small images within the same file. This is advantageous because the small icons required for a favicon in ICO format (16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels) can be scaled and optimized independently. At small dimensions you can't rely on the browser to automatically resize your icon in an optimal way. The ICO format is supported by all browsers and it's the only format that IE5 through IE10 supports". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Favicon.io</a></p>

    <h3>PNG - favicon.png</h3>

        <p>"The PNG format is a nice format because it's a format that most people are used to and doesn't require any special tools to create. With modern screens being high resolution the original problem of small icon dimensions for small resolutions no longer exists. For browsers that support the PNG favicon format oftentimes the quality of the favicon displayed within the browser tab or bookmarks bar will be higher than the ICO format. The disadvantage of the PNG format is that it's not compatible with IE5 through IE10". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Favicon.io</a></p>

    <h3>SVG - favicon.svg</h3>

        <p>"The SVG format has benefits over the PNG and ICO formats, but doesn't have great browser support yet. SVG files (Scalable Vector Graphics) are very lightweight and, being a "vector" graphic, they are infinitely scalable. This means that image quality is superb without sacrificing load times for heavy images. Only Chrome, Firefox, and Opera support SVG format favicons". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Favicon.io</a></p>

    <h2>How to add a favicon to the page/site:</h2>

        <p>In the head area of the HTML code you type <code>link</code>. One of the Emmet Abbreviations the assistant will suggest says <code>link : favicon</code>.</p>

            <p>
                <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">
                Delete whatever comes written in the "href" quotation marks</span> and press ctrl+enter to choose your own favicon image from your project's folder (all this in the Visual Studio Code, of course).
            </p>

            <p>
               And 
                <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">don't change anytinng else</span>  in this code line given by Emmet. (Those colors here are some "span" + "style" testing.) 
            </p>

<h1>Bold and Italic</h1>
            
            <p>Here I make a <strong>bold</strong> word using the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag.</p>
            
            <p style="color: red;">Better NEVER use the tag <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> to make bold. It's not semantic. This tag <q>should be used to markup text as bold without conveying any extra importance, for example in article abstracts, where the beginning of an article is set in bold text</q>. <br>(quackit.com).</p>
                        
            <p>And here's an <em>italic</em> word made with the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag.</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Avoid using the tag <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for italic. It's not a much appropriate semantic element.</p>

<h1>Wrap with abbreviation (a VS Code shortcut)</h1>

            <p>To put any lenght of text (from a single letter to a group of paragraphs) inside a tag:</p>
            <p>Just press <em>Ctrl + shift + p</em> then find "wrap with abbreviation", select it with <em>enter</em> and type only the letters that represent the tag you want. Only the letters, without the &lt; and &GT; signs. And <em>enter</em> to finalize. Ready! It's wrapped. The next times you do that, just press ctrl+shift+p and the option will already be there in the recent history and you proceed with the rest of the instructions above. </p>

<h1>
    <mark>Mark</mark> the text
</h1>

<p>The <code>&ltmark&gt;</code> tag makes the above <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading (which I had "styled" to green) return to its original color, black.</p>

<p>If you want it to continue the green CSS style I have defined for all <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags you have to force it by applying an INLINE CSS to the <code>&ltmark&gt;</code> tag opening as follows:</p>

<h1 style="margin-left: 200px;">
    <mark style="color:darkgreen;">Mark</mark> the text
</h1>

<p>And if the yellow mark doesn't match your overall background-color, just do the same as above adding a background-color to the mark's opening tag style. See:</p>

<h1 style="margin-left: 200px;">
    <mark style="color:darkgreen; background-color: lime;">Mark</mark> the text
</h1>

        <p>Mark the text. Don't mark bobeira!</p>

<h1>
    HOW TO DISPLAY CODE
</h1>

<h2>
    The <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag:
</h2>

            <p>The code tag above is between the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags, which turns the fonts into <mark>"monospaced"</mark>. The <code>black background and the green font color</code> are CSS styles I have added. The same happens with the open and close tag symbols, which I added through the "HTML entities" we will see in the next topic.
            </p>

            <p>
                <q>A monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space. This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the letters and spacings have different widths. Check the comparison below.</q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> (From Wikipedia)</a>.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/Proportional-vs-monospace-v5.svg.png" alt="proportional versus monospaced image comparison." style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            </figure>

            <p>
            If you just put a JS code snippet into a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag it does not replicate the line breaks and the identing, like the example below:
            </p>

            <p>
    <code>
        matches.forEach(function(match) {
            match.parentNode.removeChild(match);
          });
    </code>
            </p>

            <p>
            It's just rendered as monospaced font (and - in this particular case - plus the black and green CSS I applied to all the code tags).
            </p>

<h2>
    The <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag:
</h2>

            <p>
            So if you really want it to be displayed like the real code in the editor <mark>you must apply the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag <strong>inside</strong> the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag</mark> (check the source).</p>
            
            <p>This tag also displays the text as it is formated at the origin, or PRE-formated (hence the name of the tag).</p>
            
            <p>And it renders code as follows:</p>


            <p>
    <pre>
<code style="line-height: 18px; background-color: rgba(250, 235, 215, 0.30); color: black;">
        matches.forEach(function(match) { 
            match.parentNode.removeChild(match);
        });</code>
    </pre>
            </p>


            <p>Important remarks:<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Line height was set to 18px so the braces opening was not cut by the second line background color.</li>
                    <li>I removed the black and green CSS I applied (with regrets and I've learned from that) to all the code tags.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            </p>

            <p><mark>*!!! Be careful !!! - It's not quite like that</mark>, as the very site continues:</p>
    
            <p><q>If you have to display reserved characters such as <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&amp;</code> and <code>"</code> within the &lt;pre&gt; tag, they must be <strong style="color: black;"><mark>escaped</mark></strong> using their respective <strong style="color: black;">HTML <mark>entity</mark></strong>.</q></p>
</div>

        <p>IN OTHER WORDS, YOU MUST CANCELL THE HTML "CODE EFFECT" OF THOSE SYMBOLS (when displaying code) AS FOLLOWS:</p>

<div class="entity">
    <h2 style="color: black;">Do you remember what HTML <mark>entities</mark> are?</h2>
    
            <h3>We've seen them  <a href="#above">above (check first)</a>.</h3>
            
            <p>Now let's review and see where they fit:
    
            <p>Entities are used to return / display special symbols.</p>
    
            <p>"An HTML entity  is used to display invisible and reserved characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code.</p>
    
            <p>n HTML entity is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; )./p>
    
            <p>For instance, HTML will interpret the <q>less-than</q> sign ( &lt; ) as a tag opening if you don't write it as an entity.</p>
</div>

<h2>The <code>&amp;lt;</code> entity makes <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span></h2>
<p>
    When I type the 3 characters above together (without scaping through an entity) they make this symbol: &lt;</p>
<p>
    But if I want to show you the code that makes &lt; I have to replace the & (ampersand) for its respactive entity, which is "&amp;amp".
</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong> (LT in lowercase) means <q>LESS THAN.</q></p>
<P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

<h2>The <code>&amp;gt;</code> entity makes <span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span> </h2>
<p>The same as above applies here, with "gt" instead of that.</p>


<div class="entity">
    <h3>Here we have some symbols written this way:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>&reg;</li>
