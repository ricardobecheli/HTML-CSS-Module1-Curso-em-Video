    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first HTML document in this course.</p>
        <p>This is an unique moment. I'm creating a wewbsite (don't blame me. It's the teacher's text).</p>
    <hr>

    <h1>hr tag</h1>
        <p>The <code> hr </code>tag makes the line above. (the br characters in the begining of this paragraph are between the "code" tags, which turns the fonts into monospaced. That's the tag used by html to display code.)</p>
    <h1>br tag</h1>
        <p> The br tag breaks a line like now <br> (for whatever reason you may have), without being a paragraph. [after the word "now" there is s br tag]</p>
    <h1>"& lt" tag:</h1>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (without the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &lt</p>
        <p><strong>lt</strong>  means <q>lower than.</q></p>
    <h1>"& gt" tag:</h1>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (without the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &gt</p>
        <p><strong>gt</strong>  means <q>greater than.</q></p>
