    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first HTML document in this course. <em>Ricardo Barros Becheli, January 31, 2022.</em></p>
        <h4>Curso em VÃ­deo channel - YouTube - Teacher: Gustavo Guanabara</h4>

        <p>I'll be using the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>  tag to make bold text and the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>  tag to make italic before the first lessons mention them. The same goes to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>  tag to make links.</p>

    <hr>
    <div class="comment">
        <h3>
            Some CSS is needed from the very beginning to avoid visual chaos <br> with so many information within the same page.
        </h3>
    
            <p>* There are three ways you can use to implement CSS into your HTML (CSS lessons with details will come later in this course):</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="color: blue;">"INTERNAL"</span>: When it's added in the "head" section of your document;</li>
                    <li><span style="color: blue;">"INLINE"</span>: Applyed to a specific HTLM element in a lilne/paragraph; </li>
                    <li><span style="color: blue;">"EXTERNAL"</span>: All the CSS lies on a separate document in your project, properly linked to the HTML document.</li>
                </ol>
    
            <p>This purple area here was implemented by the <span style="color: blue; background-color: white;">"EXTERNAL"</span> way. But the effect in this word back here was done <span style="color: blue; background-color: white;">"INLINE"</span>.</p>
    
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h1><em>hr</em>  tag</h1>
        <p>The <code> &lt;hr&gt;</code>* tag (hr stands for "horizontal rule". It makes an HORIZONTAL LINE). The the <span style="color: red;">red line</span> above here. It's originally black but I applied some <span style="color: blue;">style</span>  to it in the <span style="color: blue;">head</span> area of the HTML basic structure (but here, in this paragraph, it was in the middle of the paragraph (called "<span style="color: blue;">in line</span> style"*), using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> 3 times).</p>


        <p>The hr characters in the begining of the above paragraph are between the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>  tags, which turns the fonts into "monospaced". That's the tag used by html to display code.)</p>

    <h1><em>br</em>  tag</h1>
        <p> The br tag breaks a line like now <br> (for whatever reason you may have), without being a paragraph. [after the word "now" there is a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag]</p>

    <h1>Entities</h1>
    <h3>Entities are used to return / display special symbols.</h3>
            
        <p>"An HTML <strong>entity</strong>  is used to display <strong>invisible characters</strong>   and <strong>reserved characters</strong>  that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code.</p>
        
        <p> <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">An HTML entity is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).</span></p>

        <p>For instance, HTML will interpret the less-than sign ( &lt; ) as a tag opening if you don't write it as an entity.</p>

    <h2><code>& lt;</code> entity* = <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span></h2>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (without the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &lt;</p>
        <p><strong>lt</strong>  means <q>LESS THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

    <h2><code>& gt;</code> entity* = <span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span> </h2>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (<strong>without</strong>  the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &gt;</p> <!-- ComentÃ¡rio Ã© assim, lembra? Abre tag, exclamaÃ§Ã£o, dois traÃ§os. -->
        <p><strong>gt</strong>  means <q>GREATER THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>


    <h3>Here we have some symbols written this way:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>&reg;</li>
        <li>&copy;</li>
        <li>&trade;</li>
        <li>&yen;</li>
        <li>&phone;</li>
        <li>&female;</li>
        <li>&spades;</li>
        <li>&numero;</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Emojis:</h1>
        <p>Emojis codes are a little more complicated to insert.</p>
        <p>First go to a website like the one linked below and:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose the emoji;</li>
            <li>Scroll down until you find the word "Codepoints".</li>
            <li>Copy that code and paste it in your editor.</li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT COMPLICATION: Remove the u+ and replace it with &#x then add a ; (semicolon) at the end.</li>
            <li>Could be easier. Should be easier. Must be easier!!!</li>
            <li>Of course when you get to the site linked below you may just copy and paste the emoji itself (just like that: ðŸ˜Š), but it won't work in some browsers, as teacher Guanabara said.</li>
        </ol>


        <p><a href="https://emojipedia.org/">Through this link you to to a COMPLETE LIST of emojis and their codes.</a></p>

        <p>And here we have some emojis coded the complicated (and only) way to code emojis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&#x1F648</li>
            <li>&#x1F440</li>
            <li>&#x1F60A</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Images</h1>
        <p>Always be sure that you are not violating copyrights when pasting images made by someone else into your website.</p>
        <p>There are royalty free images around the web, like:</p>
        <p><a href="https://pixnio.com/pt/">Pixnio</a></p>
        <p>Or</p>
        <p><a href="https://pxhere.com/">Pxhere</a></p>
        <p>Or many others.</p>
        <p>This image is from Pixnio. Very easy. You don't even have to register in their website. And you have size options. I chose a personalized one with 200px height.</p>
        <img src="images/PIXNIO-2761210-267x200.jpg" alt="Pixnio image.">

    <h2>How to add images to your page</h2>

    <h3>1) From a folder of yours:</h3>

        <p>First, download the image to your "images" folder within your HTML project.</p>
        <p>(If you're a beginner like me, going through Visual Studio Code tutorials is not a bad idea)</p>
        <p>Then, in the VSCode editor: just type <code>img</code> and Emmet, the automatic assistant, will write the rest for you. After it's done, place the cursor in between the first quotation marks (src="") of the "img" tag, press ctrl+spacebar and chose your image from your folder on the dialogue box.</p>
        <p>The second quotation marks (alt="") of the "img" tag are for you to write a quick description of the picture. It serves to appear in the screen in case the image doesn't load for any reason AND to be read out loud for those who wish the browser to do that.</p>
        

    <h3>2) Straight from another website:</h3>

        <p>Copying an image <strong>address</strong>   from another website is an alternative way of adding an image to your page.</p>
        <p>The disadvantage is that the image in your page will always depend on the existence of the original one and more: it must be exactly where it was when you copied the eddress. If their website crashes, your linked image crashes. If they change anything in the addres, the link is gone and so does the image.</p>
        <p>Just right click any image of any website and choose "copy image address" (or whatever is closer to that). Then, paste it between the first quotation marks (src="") of the "img" tag.</p>
        <p>Again: The second quotation marks (alt="") of the "img" tag are for you to write a quick description of the picture. It serves to appear in the screen in case the image doesn't load for any reason AND to be read out loud for those who wish the browser to do that.</p>
        <p>This is an example (linked from G1.com):</p>
        <img src="https://s2.glbimg.com/DHCxxKd2oxxJwWNSGcbtwhTDapA=/0x0:1200x5562/640x0/smart/filters:strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_59edd422c0c84a879bd37670ae4f538a/internal_photos/bs/2022/8/c/wBz1OySaygj4v3cLRJTw/0102-cadeira-escritorio-ergonomia.jpg" alt="Imagem do G1" width="300">

    <h2>Types of images</h2>

        <p>In a few words:</p>

        <hr>

        <p>JPG (or JPEG) Is better if you want a big image with less weight, like this one:</p>
        <div class="pic">
        <img src="images/landscape.jpg" alt="swimming pool near the ocean landdscape" width="1200px">
        </div>
    <hr>

        <div class="ball">

        <p style="font-size:x-large;">PNG images are better if you want the picture to have a transparent background (no picture frame, too), like these ones:</p>

        <img src="images/baloon.png" alt="baloons" width="400px">
        <img src="images/hand.png" alt="hand" width="300px" >
        <img src="images/baloon.png" alt="baloons" width="200px">

        <p style="font-size:x-large;">I implemented a blue background (in a "div" "class" called "ball") to make it easier to check the image's transparency.</p>

        </div>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/baloon.png" alt="baloons" width="200px">

        <p>If you want to optimize the image, please use GIMP freeware (the "free photoshop") to "save to web" and automatically reduce a lot of the image's weight without loosing much quality.</p>

    <hr style="margin-bottom: 80px;">
     

    <h1>Favicon</h1>

        <p>"A favicon is a small icon or collection of icons associated with a website, web page, or web application. It's displayed within the browser tabs and bookmarks bar".  <a href="https://favicon.io/">Favicon.io</a></p>

        <p>"A favicon is used to help users visually identify websites, web pages, and web applications within browser tabs, bookmarks, shortcuts, and address bars more easily. It's important to have a favicon for your website for brand recognition so that your users can easily identify your site in their browser tabs and bookmarks". <a href="https://favicon.io/">Favicon.io</a></p>

        <p>Examples of favicon:</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/example01-favicon.jpg" alt="Example of favicon-01" width="25%">
        <hr>
        <img src="images/example02-favicon.jpg" alt="Example of favicon-02" width="25%">
        <hr>


        

    <h2>What are common favicon file formats?</h2>
    <h3>ICO - favicon.ico</h3>
        <p>"The most common favicon formats are ICO, PNG, and SVG, but there are additional formats for specific browsers or devices. The ICO file format was developed by Microsoft and is the original file format for the favicon. The format is unique because it allows for multiple small images within the same file. This is advantageous because the small icons required for a favicon in ICO format (16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels) can be scaled and optimized independently. At small dimensions you can't rely on the browser to automatically resize your icon in an optimal way. The ICO format is supported by all browsers and it's the only format that IE5 through IE10 supports". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/">Favicon.io</a></p>

    <h3>PNG - favicon.png</h3>

        <p>"The PNG format is a nice format because it's a format that most people are used to and doesn't require any special tools to create. With modern screens being high resolution the original problem of small icon dimensions for small resolutions no longer exists. For browsers that support the PNG favicon format oftentimes the quality of the favicon displayed within the browser tab or bookmarks bar will be higher than the ICO format. The disadvantage of the PNG format is that it's not compatible with IE5 through IE10". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/">Favicon.io</a></p>

    <h3>SVG - favicon.svg</h3>

        <p>"The SVG format has benefits over the PNG and ICO formats, but doesn't have great browser support yet. SVG files (Scalable Vector Graphics) are very lightweight and, being a "vector" graphic, they are infinitely scalable. This means that image quality is superb without sacrificing load times for heavy images. Only Chrome, Firefox, and Opera support SVG format favicons". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/">Favicon.io</a></p>

    <h2>How to add a favicon to the page/site:</h2>

        <p>In the head area of the HTML code you type <code>link</code>. One of the Emmet Abbreviations the assistant will suggest says <code>link : favicon</code>.</p>

            <p>
                <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">
                Delete whatever comes written in the "href" quotation marks</span> and press ctrl+enter to choose your own favicon image from your project's folder (all this in the Visual Studio Code, of course).
            </p>

            <p>
               And 
                <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">don't change anytinng else</span>  in this code line given by Emmet. (Those colors here are some "span" + "style" testing.) 
            </p>
