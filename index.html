<h1>Important CSS remarks:</h1>

        <p>This course is beginning with <code>html</code> but let's do some small things in advance:</p>


        <p>
            I decided that a small amount of CSS <em>(which means all that I know so far = very small amount and not always the best way)</em> is needed from the very beginning to avoid visual boring confusion with so much information in the same page.
        </p>

        <p>Also later this that now is a big page will be divided and become a website with a navigation nenu or bar.</p>

        <p>
            Then, with time, the appropriate CSS3 lessons will come and, with them, the best practices and techniques of CSS3. I say this on February 11, 2022. Github can tell you the whole story, step by step at: <a href="https://github.com/ricardobecheli/HTML-CSS-Module1-Curso-em-Video" target="blank">github.com/ricardobecheli/HTML-CSS-Module1-Curso-em-Video</a> </p>
    
        <p>* There are three ways you can use to implement CSS into your HTML (CSS lessons with <strong>details will come later in this course</strong>):</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="color: blue;">"INTERNAL"</span>: When it's added in the "head" section of your document;</li>
                    <li><span style="color: blue;">"INLINE"</span>: Applyed to a specific HTLM element in a lilne/paragraph; </li>
                    <li><span style="color: blue;">"EXTERNAL"</span>: All the CSS lies on a separate document in your project, properly linked to the HTML document. That's the most used way.</li>
                </ol>
    
        <p>This purple area here was implemented by the <span style="color: blue; background-color: white;">"EXTERNAL"</span> way. But the effect in this word back here was done <span style="color: blue; background-color: white;">"INLINE"</span>.</p>
        
        
        <div class="obs">
            <p>Maybe I'm overusing CSS. Sorry. I have to <em>overpractice</em> while I can.</p>
            <p>I realize that my CSS is imperfect so far because it loses alignment when the screen zoom changes to more than 100%, for instance.</p>
            <p>And this is only one of the mistakes. I'm aware of them and will learn the right way when the lessons get to that point.</p>

<h1>THE COURSE STARTS HERE</h1>

<h1>HTML <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> Declaration</h1>

            <p>All HTML5 documents <mark>must</mark> start with a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration.</p>
            <p>The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.</p>
            <p>In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:</p>
            <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></p>

            <p>The 3 paragraphs above were taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp" target="blank">W3schools.</a> It's worth a visit.</p>

            <p>That's how an HTML5 document is born.</p>

            <p>Any other thing typed after <code>!DOCTYPE</code> than only <code>html</code> will not make an HTML5 document. It could build a previous and outdated html document (like html4) or nothing at all if it's an invalid code.</p>

            <p>But you don't have to type it all. Not in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor.</p>

            <p><mark>VS Code has a typing assistant called Emmet</mark> that sort of guesses what you are about to type and gives you hints to choose.</p>

            <P>Thus, <mark>just type <code>!</code> in a blank HTML document</mark>. The figure of a tool followed by any options of <code>!</code> Emmet may have wil instantly appear in a blue background near to your cursor, like that:</P>

            
    <figure>
            <img src="images/emmet.jpg" width="1000px" alt="Visual Studio Code screen with Emmet in action.">

    </figure>       
                
                
                
            <p>Then, press <code>Enter</code> and it's done.</p>

            <p>Learn more about Emmet in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet" target="blank">VS Code website.</a></p>

            <p>What will appear as a result of that is the folowing:</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/html-skeleton-from-codegrepper-dot-com.png" alt="html skeleton.">
                <figcaption><em>Credit:Image from codegrepper.com</em></figcaption>
            </figure>

        <p><mark>AND LATER, WHEN YOU PROGRESS IN FRONT-END:</mark></p>
        <p>You will implement some mandatory things to that basic srtucture, like the:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Link to <em>external</em>* CSS <mark>stylesheet</mark> (in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area) 
        </li>
        <li>
            The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> link (in the end of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> area) to an <em>external</em>* JavaScript document.
        </li>
    </ol>        
        <p>* <em>External to the html document but still being part of your project.</em></p>
        <p>See how the few extra implements will look like:</p>

            </figure>

<h1>Title</h1>
        
        <p>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area is the name your page or website will display in the TAB top.</p>
        <p>An example from seo-gold.com:</p>

            </figure>

<h1>HTML Semantic Elements</h1>

        <p>Semantic elements = elements with a meaning. <mark>HTML5 was built to be semantic, to attribute meaning to its content</mark>.</p>

        <p>What are Semantic Elements?</p>
        <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</p>

        <p style="color: blueviolet; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">The opposite of that are the CSS styles, which give a <em>form</em>, a <em>look</em> to the content, like now.</p>

        <p>Examples of non-semantic elements: <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> - Tells nothing about its content, they just select an area (to be worked by CSS or JS).</p>

        <p>Examples of semantic elements: <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and many others. They clearly define their content.</p>
        <p>Learn more at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="blank">w3schools</a>.</p>

<h1><em>hr</em> tag</h1>

        <p>The <code> &lt;hr&gt;</code>* tag (hr stands for "horizontal rule". It makes an HORIZONTAL LINE). The the <span style="color: red;">red line</span> above here. It's originally black but I applied some <span style="color: blue;">style (=CSS)</span>  to it in the <span style="color: blue;">head</span> area of the HTML basic structure (but here, in this paragraph, the colors/style were modified in the middle of the paragraph (the so called "<span style="color: blue;">inline CSS</span>" explained above.), using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> 3 times).</p>


        <p>The hr characters in the begining of the above paragraph are between the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>  tags, which turns the fonts into <mark>"monospaced"</mark>. That's the tag used by html to display code.)</p>

<h1><em>br</em>  tag</h1>
        <p> The br tag breaks a line like now <br> (for whatever reason you may have), without being a paragraph. (after the word "now" there is a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag)</p>

<h1><em>del</em> tag</h1>

        <p>The <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> tag <del>marks a text as non-valid</del> or deleted.</p>

<h1><em>ins</em> tag</h1>
        <p>The <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> tag underlines the text to give the kind of enphasis s if he text has been <ins>filled in the blank space, or inserted</ins>.</p>
        <p><mark>Don't confuse this tag with the "u" one</mark>. "U" is not semantic. It just <u>underlines</u> and that's it, no meanings whatsoever.</p>

<h1><em>small</em> tag</h1>
        <p>This tag can be used in those small <small>contract/agreement/purchase order/invoice</small> letters.</p>
        <p>The <big>"big"</big> tag is not used any longer. It works, thou. This task (enlarging) now is CSS business.</p>
<h1><em>sup</em> tag</h1>
        <p>The superscript tag is good to format things like 18<sup>25</sup>+3, for instance.</p>

<h1><em>sub</em> tag</h1>
        <p>The subscript tag doesn't make it rain but can make the H<sub>2</sub>O formula.</p>

<h1>Entities</h1>
    <h3>Entities are used to return / display special symbols.</h3>
            
        <p>"An HTML <strong>entity</strong>  is used to display <strong>invisible characters</strong>   and <strong>reserved characters</strong>  that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code.</p>
        
        <p> <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">An HTML entity is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).</span></p>

        <p>For instance, HTML will interpret the less-than sign ( &lt; ) as a tag opening if you don't write it as an entity.</p>

    <h2><code>& lt;</code> entity = <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span></h2>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (without the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &lt;</p>
        <p><strong>lt</strong>  means <q>LESS THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

    <h2><code>& gt;</code> entity = <span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span> </h2>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (<strong>without</strong>  the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &gt;</p> <!-- Comentário é assim, lembra? Abre tag, exclamação, dois traços. -->
        <p><strong>gt</strong>  means <q>GREATER THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>


    <h3>Here we have some symbols written this way:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>&reg;</li>
        <li>&copy;</li>
        <li>&trade;</li>
        <li>&yen;</li>
        <li>&phone;</li>
        <li>&female;</li>

    </ul>

<h1>Emojis:</h1>
        <p>Emojis codes are a little more complicated to insert.</p>
        <p>First go to a website like the one linked below and:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose the emoji;</li>
            <li>Scroll down until you find the word "Codepoints".</li>
            <li>Copy that code and paste it in your editor.</li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT COMPLICATION: Remove the u+ and replace it with &#x then add a ; (semicolon) at the end.</li>
            <li>Could be easier. Should be easier. Must be easier!!!</li>
            <li>Of course when you get to the site linked below you may just copy and paste the emoji itself (just like that: 😊), but it won't work in some browsers, as teacher Guanabara said.</li>
        </ol>


        <p><a href="https://emojipedia.org/" target="blank">Through this link you to to a COMPLETE LIST of emojis and their codes.</a></p>

        <p>And here we have some emojis coded the complicated (and only) way to code emojis:</p>

        </ul>

<h1>Images</h1>


        <p>Always be sure that you are not violating copyrights when pasting images made by someone else into your website.</p>
        <p>There are royalty free images around the web, like:</p>
        <p><a href="https://pixnio.com/pt/" target="blank">Pixnio</a></p>
        <p>Or</p>
        <p><a href="https://pxhere.com/" target="blank">Pxhere</a></p>
        <p>Or many others.</p>
        <p>This image is from Pixnio. Very easy. You don't even have to register in their website. And you have size options. You can even chose a personalized one with the width or height of your preference.</p>

        </div>


    <h2>How to add images to your page</h2>

    <h3>1) From a folder of yours:</h3>

        <p>First, download the image to your "images" folder within your HTML project.</p>
        <p>(If you're a beginner like me, going through Visual Studio Code tutorials is not a bad idea)</p>
        <p>Then, in the VSCode editor: just type <code>img</code> and Emmet, the automatic assistant, will write the rest for you. After it's done, place the cursor in between the first quotation marks (src="") of the "img" tag, press ctrl+spacebar and chose your image from your folder on the dialogue box.</p>
        <p>The second quotation marks (alt="") of the "img" tag are for you to write a quick description of the picture. It serves to appear in the screen in case the image doesn't load for any reason AND to be read out loud for those who wish the browser to do that.</p>
        

    <h3>2) Straight from another website:</h3>

        <p>Copying an image <strong>address</strong>   from another website is an alternative way of adding an image to your page.</p>
        <p>The disadvantage is that the image in your page will always depend on the existence of the original one and more: it must be exactly where it was when you copied the eddress. If their website crashes, your linked image crashes. If they change anything in the addres, the link is gone and so does the image.</p>
        <p>Just right click any image of any website and choose "copy image address" (or whatever is closer to that). Then, paste it between the first quotation marks (src="") of the "img" tag.</p>
        <p>Again: The second quotation marks (alt="") of the "img" tag are for you to write a quick description of the picture. It serves to appear in the screen in case the image doesn't load for any reason AND to be read out loud for those who wish the browser to do that.</p>
        <p>This is an example (linked from G1.com):</p>
        <img src="https://s2.glbimg.com/DHCxxKd2oxxJwWNSGcbtwhTDapA=/0x0:1200x5562/640x0/smart/filters:strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_59edd422c0c84a879bd37670ae4f538a/internal_photos/bs/2022/8/c/wBz1OySaygj4v3cLRJTw/0102-cadeira-escritorio-ergonomia.jpg" alt="Imagem do G1" width="300">

    <h2>Types of images</h2>

        <p>In a few words:</p>

        <hr>

        <p>JPG (or JPEG) Is better if you want a big image with less weight, like this one:</p>


        <div class="pic">
        <img src="images/landscape.jpg" alt="swimming pool near the ocean landdscape" width="1200px">
        </div>
    <hr>

    <div class="blue">

        <p style="font-size:x-large; text-align: justify;">PNG images are better if you want the picture itself to have a transparent background (and no picture frame), like these ones:</p>

        
            <div class="balls-hand">
                <img src="images/baloon.png" alt="baloons" width="400px">
            </div>

            <div class="balls-hand">
                <img src="images/hand.png" alt="hand" width="300px" >
            </div>

            <div class="balls-hand">           
                <img src="images/spiderman.png" alt="baloons" width="200px">
            </div>
        



    </div>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">I've implemented a blue background (in a "div" "class" called "balls-hand" inside another div class called "blue" in the head sector of this HTML document) to make it easier to check the image's transparency and to align them. <br>Images from <a href="https://www.pngwing.com/en/search?q=free+download" target="blank">pngwing.com</a> .</p>

        <hr>
        <img src="images/baloon.png" alt="baloons" width="200px">

        <p>If you want to optimize the image, please use GIMP freeware (the "free photoshop") to "save for web" (a plugin) and automatically reduce a lot of the image's weight without loosing much quality.</p>

    <hr style="margin-bottom: 80px;">
     

<h1>Favicon</h1>

        <p>"A favicon is a small icon or collection of icons associated with a website, web page, or web application. It's displayed within the browser tabs and bookmarks bar".  <a href="https://favicon.io/" target="blank">Favicon.io</a></p>

        <p>"A favicon is used to help users visually identify websites, web pages, and web applications within browser tabs, bookmarks, shortcuts, and address bars more easily. It's important to have a favicon for your website for brand recognition so that your users can easily identify your site in their browser tabs and bookmarks". <a href="https://favicon.io/" target="blank">Favicon.io</a></p>

        <p>Examples of favicon:</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/example01-favicon.jpg" alt="Example of favicon-01" width="25%">
        <hr>
        <img src="images/example02-favicon.jpg" alt="Example of favicon-02" width="25%">
        <hr>


        

    <h2>What are common favicon file formats?</h2>
    <h3>ICO - favicon.ico</h3>
        <p>"The most common favicon formats are ICO, PNG, and SVG, but there are additional formats for specific browsers or devices. The ICO file format was developed by Microsoft and is the original file format for the favicon. The format is unique because it allows for multiple small images within the same file. This is advantageous because the small icons required for a favicon in ICO format (16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels) can be scaled and optimized independently. At small dimensions you can't rely on the browser to automatically resize your icon in an optimal way. The ICO format is supported by all browsers and it's the only format that IE5 through IE10 supports". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/" target="blank">Favicon.io</a></p>

    <h3>PNG - favicon.png</h3>

        <p>"The PNG format is a nice format because it's a format that most people are used to and doesn't require any special tools to create. With modern screens being high resolution the original problem of small icon dimensions for small resolutions no longer exists. For browsers that support the PNG favicon format oftentimes the quality of the favicon displayed within the browser tab or bookmarks bar will be higher than the ICO format. The disadvantage of the PNG format is that it's not compatible with IE5 through IE10". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/" target="blank">Favicon.io</a></p>

    <h3>SVG - favicon.svg</h3>

        <p>"The SVG format has benefits over the PNG and ICO formats, but doesn't have great browser support yet. SVG files (Scalable Vector Graphics) are very lightweight and, being a "vector" graphic, they are infinitely scalable. This means that image quality is superb without sacrificing load times for heavy images. Only Chrome, Firefox, and Opera support SVG format favicons". <a href="https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/" target="blank">Favicon.io</a></p>

        <p>In the head area of the HTML code you type <code>link</code>. One of the Emmet Abbreviations the assistant will suggest says <code>link : favicon</code>.</p>

            <p>
                <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">
                Delete whatever comes written in the "href" quotation marks</span> and press ctrl+enter to choose your own favicon image from your project's folder (all this in the Visual Studio Code, of course).
            </p>

            <p>
               And 
                <span style="color: yellow; background-color: gray;">don't change anytinng else</span>  in this code line given by Emmet. (Those colors here are some "span" + "style" testing.) 
            </p>

<h1>Bold and Italic</h1>
            
            <p>Here I make a <strong>bold</strong> word using the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag.</p>
            
            <p style="color: red;">Better NEVER use the tag <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> to make bold. It's not semantic. This tag <q>should be used to markup text as bold without conveying any extra importance, for example in article abstracts, where the beginning of an article is set in bold text</q>. <br>(quackit.com).</p>
                        
            <p>And here's an <em>italic</em> word made with the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag.</p>
            <p style="color: red;">Avoid using the tag <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for italic. It's not a much appropriate semantic element.</p>

<h1>Wrap with abbreviation (a VS Code shortcut)</h1>

            <p>To put any lenght of text (from a single letter to a group of paragraphs) inside a tag:</p>
            <p>Just press <em>Ctrl + shift + p</em> then find "wrap with abbreviation", select it with <em>enter</em> and type only the letters that represent the tag you want. Only the letters, without the &lt; and &GT; signs. And <em>enter</em> to finalize. Ready! It's wrapped. The next times you do that, just press ctrl+shift+p and the option will already be there in the recent history and you proceed with the rest of the instructions above. </p>

<h1>
    <mark>Mark</mark> the text
</h1>

<p>The <code>&ltmark&gt;</code> tag makes the above <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading (which I had "styled" to green) return to its original color, black.</p>
<p>If you want it to continue the green CSS style I have defined for all <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags you have to force it by applying an INLINE CSS to the <code>&ltmark&gt;</code> tag opening as follows:</p>

<h1 style="margin-left: 200px;">
    <mark style="color:darkgreen;">Mark</mark> the text
</h1>

<p>And if the yellow mark doesn't match your overall background-color, just do the same as above adding a background-color to the mark's opening tag style. See:</p>

<h1 style="margin-left: 200px;">
    <mark style="color:darkgreen; background-color: lime;">Mark</mark> the text
</h1>

<p>Mark the text. Don't mark bobeira!</p>

<h1>
    HOW TO DISPLAY CODE
</h1>

<h2>
    The <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag:
</h2>

<p>
    If you just put a JS code snippet into a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag like that:
</p>

<p>
    
    <code>
        matches.forEach(function(match) {
            match.parentNode.removeChild(match);
          });
    </code>
</p>

<p>
    It's just rendered as monospaced font (and - in this particular case - plus the black and green CSS I applied to all the code tags). No line separations, no indentation.
</p>

<h2>
    The <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag:
</h2>

<p>So if you really want it to be displayed like the real code in the editor you must apply the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag, as follows:</p>

<p>
    <pre>
        matches.forEach(function(match) {
            match.parentNode.removeChild(match);
          });
    </pre>
</p>

<p>The above is the code as it was written.</p>

<h2>More important information about that from my Rocketseat course page:</h2>
<p>Pay attention where it mentions the HTML entities.</p>

<div class="displaycode">
<h2>&lt;pre&gt; THE <em>PREFORMATED TEXT</em> ELEMENT</h2>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The HTML element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly(*!!!) as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font" target="blank">monospaced</a>, font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written. <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre">MDN Web Docs</a></cite></p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>

<p>*!!! - It's not quite like that, as the very site continues:</p>

<p><q>If you have to display reserved characters such as <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&amp;</code> and <code>"</code> within the &lt;pre&gt; tag, the characters must be <strong style="color: black;">escaped</strong> using their respective <strong style="color: black;">HTML entity</strong>.</q></p>

<p>IN OTHER WORDS, YOU MUST CANCELL THE HTML "CODE EFFECT" OF THOSE SYMBOLS (when displaying code).</p>

<h2 style="color: black;">What are HTML entities?</h2>

<p>Entities are used to return / display special symbols.</p>
    
<p>"An HTML entity  is used to display invisible and reserved characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code.</p>

<p> <span style="color: black; background-color: gray;">An HTML entity is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).</span></p>

<p>For instance, HTML will interpret the <q>less-than</q> sign ( &lt; ) as a tag opening if you don't write it as an entity.</p>

<h2><code>& lt;</code> entity = <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span></h2>
<p>When I type the 3 characters above together (without the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &lt;</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>  means <q>LESS THAN.</q></p>
<P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

<h2><code>& gt;</code> entity = <span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span> </h2>
<p>When I type the 3 characters above together (<strong>without</strong>  the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &gt;</p> <!-- Comentário é assim, lembra? Abre tag, exclamação, dois traços. -->
<p><strong>gt</strong>  means <q>GREATER THAN.</q></p>
<P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>


<h3>Here we have some symbols written this way:</h3>
<ul>
<li>&reg;</li>
<li>&copy;</li>
<li>&trade;</li>
<li>&yen;</li>
<li>&phone;</li>
<li>&female;</li>
