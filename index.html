    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first HTML document in this course.</p>
        <p>This is an unique moment. I'm creating a wewbsite (don't blame me. It's the teacher's text).</p>
        <p>I'll be using the &lt;strong&gt; tag to make bold text and the &lt;em&gt; tag to make italic before the first lessons mention them. The same goes to the &lt;a&gt; tag to make links.</p>
        <p><em>Ricardo Barros Becheli, January 31, 2022.</em></p>

    <h1><em>hr</em>  tag</h1>
        <p>The <code> hr </code>* tag makes the line above. It's originally black but I applied some <span style="color: red;">style</span>  to it in the head area (but here it was in the middle of the paragraph, using span).<br>
        (the hr characters in the begining of the above paragraph are between the "code" tags, which turns the fonts into monospaced. That's the tag used by html to display code.)</p>
        <p>* hr stands for "horizontal rule". It makes an HORIZONTAL LINE.</p>

    <h1><em>br</em>  tag</h1>
        <p> The br tag breaks a line like now <br> (for whatever reason you may have), without being a paragraph. [after the word "now" there is s br tag]</p>

    <h1><em>& lt;</em> entity*:</h1>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (without the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &lt;</p>
        <p><strong>lt</strong>  means <q>LESS THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

    <h1><em>& gt;</em> entity*:</h1>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (<strong>without</strong>  the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &gt;</p> <!-- Comentário é assim, lembra? Abre tag, exclamação, dois traços. -->
        <p><strong>gt</strong>  means <q>GREATER THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

    <h1>Special symbols:</h1>
            <p>* What's an <strong>ENTITY?</strong> </p>
            <p>"An HTML <strong>entity</strong>  is used to display <strong>invisible characters</strong>   and <strong>reserved characters</strong>  that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code.</p>
            <p>It is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).
            <p> HTML will interpret the less-than sign ( < ) as a tag". (https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-are-html-entities).</p>
