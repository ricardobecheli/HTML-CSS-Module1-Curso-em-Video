    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first HTML document in this course.</p>
        <p>This is an unique moment. I'm creating a wewbsite (don't blame me. It's the teacher's text).</p>
        <p>I'll be using the &lt;strong&gt; tag to make bold text and the &lt;em&gt; tag to make italic before the first lessons mention them. The same goes to the &lt;a&gt; tag to make links.</p>
        <p><em>Ricardo Barros Becheli, January 31, 2022.</em></p>
    <hr>

    <h1><em>hr</em>  tag</h1>
        <p>The <code> hr </code>* tag makes the line above. It's originally black but I applied some <span style="color: red;">style</span>  to it in the head area (but here it was in the middle of the paragraph, using span).<br>
        (the hr characters in the begining of the above paragraph are between the "code" tags, which turns the fonts into monospaced. That's the tag used by html to display code.)</p>
        <p>* hr stands for "horizontal rule". It makes an HORIZONTAL LINE.</p>

    <h1><em>br</em>  tag</h1>
        <p> The br tag breaks a line like now <br> (for whatever reason you may have), without being a paragraph. [after the word "now" there is s br tag]</p>

    <h1><em>& lt;</em> entity*:</h1>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (without the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &lt;</p>
        <p><strong>lt</strong>  means <q>LESS THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

    <h1><em>& gt;</em> entity*:</h1>
        <p>When I type the 3 characters above together (<strong>without</strong>  the space I put there just to make it visible here) they make this symbol: &gt;</p> <!-- ComentÃ¡rio Ã© assim, lembra? Abre tag, exclamaÃ§Ã£o, dois traÃ§os. -->
        <p><strong>gt</strong>  means <q>GREATER THAN.</q></p>
        <P>Always with a semicolon at the end.</P>

    <h1>Special symbols:</h1>
            <p>* What's an <strong>ENTITY?</strong> </p>
            <p>"An HTML <strong>entity</strong>  is used to display <strong>invisible characters</strong>   and <strong>reserved characters</strong>  that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code.</p>
            <p>It is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).
            <p> HTML will interpret the less-than sign ( < ) as a tag". (https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-are-html-entities).</p>

            <p>Here we have some symbols written this way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&reg;</li>
                <li>&copy;</li>
                <li>&trade;</li>
                <li>&yen;</li>
                <li>&phone;</li>
                <li>&female;</li>
                <li>&spades;</li>
                <li>&numero;</li>
            </ul>

    <h1>Emojis:</h1>
        <p>Emojis codes are a little more complicated to insert.</p>
        <p>First go to a website like the one linked below and:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose the emoji;</li>
            <li>Scroll down until you find the word "Codepoints".</li>
            <li>Copy that code and paste it in your editor.</li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT COMPLICATION: Remove the u+ and replace it with &#x then add a ; (semicolon) at the end.</li>
            <li>Could be easier. Should be easier. Must be easier!!!</li>
            <li>Of course when you get to the site linked below you may just copy and paste the emoji itself (just like that: ðŸ˜Š), but it won't work in some browsers, as teacher Guanabara said.</li>
        </ol>


        <p><a href="https://emojipedia.org/">Through this link you to to a COMPLETE LIST of emojis and their codes.</a></p>

        <p>And here we have some emojis coded the complicated (and only) way to code emojis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&#x1F648</li>
            <li>&#x1F440</li>
            <li>&#x1F60A</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Images</h1>
        <p>Always be sure that you are not violating copyrights when pasting images made by someone else into your website.</p>
        <p>There are royalty free images around the web, like:</p>
        <p><a href="https://pixnio.com/pt/">Pixnio</a></p>
        <p>Or</p>
        <p><a href="https://pxhere.com/">Pxhere</a></p>
        <p>Or many others.</p>
        <p>This image is from Pixnio. Very easy. You don't even have to register in their website. And you have size options. I chose a personalized one with 200px height.</p>

    <h1>How to add images to your page</h1>

    <h2>1) From a folder of yours:</h2>

        <p>First, download the image to your "images" folder within your HTML project.</p>
        <p>(If you're a beginner like me, going through Visual Studio Code tutorials is not a bad idea)</p>
        <p>Then, in the VSCode editor: just type <code>img</code> and Emmet, the automatic assistant, will write the rest for you. After it's done, place the cursor in between the first quotation marks (src="") of the "img" tag, press ctrl+spacebar and chose your image from your folder on the dialogue box.</p>
        <p>The second quotation marks (alt="") of the "img" tag are for you to write a quick description of the picture. It serves to appear in the screen in case the image doesn't load for any reason AND to be read out loud for those who wish the browser to do that.</p>

    <h2>2) Straight from another website:</h2>

        <p>Copying an image address from another website is an alternative way of adding an image to your page.</p>
        <p>Just right click any image of any website and choose "copy image address" (or whatever is closer to that). Then, paste it between the first quotation marks (src="") of the "img" tag.</p>
        <p>Again: The second quotation marks (alt="") of the "img" tag are for you to write a quick description of the picture. It serves to appear in the screen in case the image doesn't load for any reason AND to be read out loud for those who wish the browser to do that.</p>

    <h1>Types of images</h1>

        <p>In a few words:</p>

        <hr>
        
        <p>JPG (or JPEG) Is better if you want a big image with less weight, like this one:</p>
        <img src="images/landscape.jpg" alt="">
        <hr>

        <div class="ball">

        <p style="font-size:x-large;">PNG images are better if you want them to have a transparent background, like this one:</p>

        <img src="images/baloon.png" alt="baloons">

        <p style="font-size:x-large;">The blue background makes it easier to check the image's transparency.</p>

        </div>

        <hr>

        <p>And use GIMP freeware (the "free photoshop") to "save to web" and automatically reduce a lot of the image's weight without loosing much quality.</p>
